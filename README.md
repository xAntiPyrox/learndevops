# Learning DevOps

Repository intended for learning the DevOps life-cycle, including CI/CD, version control, maintaining access and secrets, cloud infrastructure, and way more.

# What I'm going to do

The best way to learn a new programming process or environment in my opinion is to use it. Therefore, I'm going to use this repository to learn the process from end to end, starting with an intended product/outcome and developing not only the application itself but also the tech stack, environments, and pipelines at the same time.

Therefore, this repository will act as two major resources during this project:

1. It will act as the centralized version control for all source code and documentation written
2. It will act as a place to document thoughts, goals, and challenges, and outcomes so I can integrate them in other projects

# Project

## Problem statement

Sometimes you want to watch a movie, but it can be difficult to pick one out. You may have a long "watch later" list or a variety of streaming platforms to choose from, but nothing immediately appeals. This problem can be exacerbated when trying to pick a move with a partner or group of people where cinema tastes differ.

## Proposed solution

To develop a repository of movies and data about them, with a web interface that enables users to select a movie at random or through filtering certain criteria.
