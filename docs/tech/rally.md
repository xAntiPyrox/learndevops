# Rally

## Summary

Broadcom's Rally is a project and task management software suite designed to support teams using Agile development practices. It has a broad range of tools and features to manage user stories and tasks, group those user stories into projects and related efforts, manage team capacity and velocity, and plan and organize a backlog of enhancements and their priority for implementation.

## Project Details

This technology was automatically chosen to be incorporated into this project as it is a requirement for my current job to manage tasks and capacity. However, Rally is not available without a enterprise email to create an account with, even with the free tier advertised. Therefore, [Taiga.io](taigaio.md) will be used for task management in this project.
