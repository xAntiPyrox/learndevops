# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Summary

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a distributed cloud infrastructure offering a large variety of tools and platforms to host web applications, store data, perform analytics, and more using Google's resources.

## Project Details

This technology was automatically chosen to be incorporated into this project as it is a requirement for my current job to use GCP to launch new applications and projects. Therefore, no other cloud infrastructure providers will be considered for this project.

## Notes

**(27-FEB-22):** For the purposes of this project, the main usage for GCP will be Google's Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to host one or more [Kubernetes](k8s.md) clusters for orchestrating [Docker](docker.md) containers. However, as the project grows and evolves, this decision may change.
