## Summary

HashiCorp's Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool intended to automate the initialization, modification, and teardown steps needed to support an application. It enables using declarative document statements to engineer the architecture that will be needed to launch a given application to production. 

## Project Details

This technology was automatically chosen to be incorporated into this project as it is a requirement for my current job to use this to push changes to our GCP infrastructure. Therefore, no other IaC tools will be considered to be integrated into this project.
