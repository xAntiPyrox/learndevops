# Tekton

## Summary

Tekton is a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tool for automating the testing and deployment of code changes of a project to the intended production infrastructure.

## Project Details

This technology was automatically chosen to be incorporated into this project as it is a requirement for my current job to use this to push changes to our GCP infrastructure. Therefore, no other CI/CD tools will be considered to be integrated into this project.

## Notes
